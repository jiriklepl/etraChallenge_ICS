## What should be in the report

* Your name and date
* Describe subset of data that you will be using
* Describe hypotheses that you have about the data. 2-3 hypotheses should be enough
* Test the hypotheses using appropriate tools
* Discuss the results

## How to manipulate the data

Use **dplyr** package. There are several verbs that can be used for data manipulation, which are covered in every tutorial. Dplyr uses non standard evaluation, so most of the arguments do not need to be written in brackets

There are also *join functions which work similarly as in SQL. They might be useful when combining tables.

There are multiple tutorials for dplyr, which you can read such as [this one](https://genomicsclass.github.io/book/pages/dplyr_tutorial.html) or [this one](https://rpubs.com/coleeagland/dplyrtutorialforjohnandjenn)
